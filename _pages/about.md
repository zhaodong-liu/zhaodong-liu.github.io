My name is 刘兆东 (Zhaodong Liu), currently a senior student at New York University Shanghai, double majoring in Computer Science and Mathematics with a cumulative GPA of 3.811/4.0. My research interests lie at the intersection of **machine learning**, **natural language processing**, and **recommendation systems**. I am particularly fascinated by how large language models can understand and predict human behavior patterns, and how they can be applied to solve complex problems across diverse domains.

I had the privilege of conducting research under [Prof. Hongyi Wen](https://shanghai.nyu.edu/academics/faculty/directory/hongyi-wen) on generative retrieval for recommendation systems, where I developed multimodal models that integrate visual and textual information to predict user preferences. During my study-away at NYU New York, I worked with [Prof. He He](https://hhexiy.github.io/) at the Center for Data Science, applying language models to chemical retrosynthesis—an exciting application of AI for Science (AI4S). Through innovative data augmentation techniques, we achieved a 15.4% improvement in prediction accuracy, demonstrating the transformative potential of LLMs in scientific discovery.

Beyond research, I am deeply passionate about music. As the Trombone Section Leader of the NYU Shanghai Chamber Orchestra since 2022, I've learned that ensemble performance and research share a common thread—both require harmony between individual creativity and collective goals. It was actually through a machine learning project on music style transfer that I first witnessed the elegance of neural networks transforming raw audio into creative variations, sparking my journey into AI research. This intersection of art and science continues to inspire my work, reminding me that the most powerful algorithms are those that capture the nuances of human expression and behavior.
