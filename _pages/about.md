I am Zhaodong Liu (刘兆东), a Computer Science and Mathematics double major student at New York University Shanghai, with a cumulative GPA of 3.811/4.0. My research interests lie at the intersection of **Machine Learning**, **Natural Language Processing**, and **Recommendation Systems**.

I am passionate about leveraging data-driven approaches to solve complex problems. Currently, I am working as a Research Assistant under [Prof. Hongyi Wen](https://shanghai.nyu.edu/academics/faculty/directory/hongyi-wen) on generative retrieval for recommendation systems, where I am developing models to predict user behavior patterns using multimodal data. Previously, I worked with [Prof. He He](https://hhexiy.github.io/) at NYU's Center for Data Science on fine-tuning language models for chemical retrosynthesis, achieving a 15.4% improvement in prediction accuracy.

During my study-away semesters at NYU New York (Fall 2024 and Spring 2025), I took graduate-level courses including Natural Language Processing with Representation Learning, which deepened my understanding of Large Language Models and their applications. I have been recognized on the Dean's List for three consecutive academic years (2022-2023, 2023-2024, 2024-2025).

Beyond research, I am active in the NYU Shanghai community as the Trombone Section Leader in the Chamber Orchestra and previously served as Treasurer of the PEER-Pal Club, where I organized educational volunteering activities.
