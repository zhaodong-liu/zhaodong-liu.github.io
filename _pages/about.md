My name is 刘兆东 (Zhaodong Liu), currently a senior student at New York University Shanghai, double majoring in **Computer Science** and **Mathematics**. My research interests lie at the intersection of **machine learning**, **natural language processing**, **recommendation systems**, and **multimodal learning**. I am particularly fascinated by how large language models can understand and predict human behavior patterns, and how they can be applied to solve complex problems across diverse domains.
